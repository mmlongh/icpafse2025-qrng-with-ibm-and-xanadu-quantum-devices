# ICPAFSE 2025: A Study of Gate-Based and Boson Sampling Quantum Random Number Generation on IBM and Xanadu Quantum Computers

This repository contains the data, code, and results used in our submission to the [First International Conference on Physics and its Application in Fundamental Science and Engineering (ICPAFSE 2025)](https://www.univ-medea.dz/icpafse2025/), to-be-hold from October 28–30, 2025, at the University of Medea, Algeria. The paper investigates Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) using both gate-based and boson sampling quantum computers as entropy sources. It introduces unbiasing methods—including the classical Von Neumann extractor and two new variants—designed to correct for bias in correlated quantum outputs. Randomness quality is evaluated using the [NIST SP800-22r1a test suite](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/22/r1/upd1/final) ([https://github.com/dj-on-github/sp800_22_tests](https://github.com/dj-on-github/sp800_22_tests)), with data collected from IBM Sherbrooke (our own experiment) and Xanadu Borealis (from: ) devices. The preprint can be found [here](LINK).
